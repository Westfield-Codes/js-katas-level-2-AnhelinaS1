/* 2. for loop and array with toString */

 * build shopArray variable for the shopping list
 * adjust loop to work with the array index values (start at 0)
 * ask for next list item and push it to the shopArray
 * no need to add a line break after
 * at end of loop, alert the list title, followed by
 * the list with toString() method (it won't have line breaks)*/

/* 3. for loop and array with join method 

/* Same function, using previous code, BUT:
 * the at end, alert list with array.join() method with line breaks 
 * instead of commas */
 
/* 4. loops, arrays and functions */

/* Same function, using previous code, but THIS TIME:
 * store each item as a numbered item ["1. cookies","2. donuts"])   
 * using the loop index. */
